# CollisionManager
A ground up step by step approach towards a C++ collision manager that can be later plugged into a larger larger project.

## Point2D
A class representing a two dimensional geographical point

### Point2D operator +(Point2D movement)
Sum the coordinates of the point with another

### string toString();
Return a jsonified string version of the object

### string toString(string tabbing);
Return a jsonified string version of the object tabbed in line with the passed parameter eg: “\t\t”

## Point3D
A class representing a three dimensional geographical point

### Point3D operator +(Point3D movement)
Sum the coordinates of the point with another

### string toString();
Return a jsonified string version of the object

### string toString(string tabbing);
Return a jsonified string version of the object tabbed in line with the passed parameter eg: “\t\t”
